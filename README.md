# Global Historical Emissions Analysis
This was a group project by Richard Kim (https://github.com/richardhkim), Kai Murata (https://github.com/KaizaM), and Hana Tafesse (https://github.com/HanaTafesse)

Climate change is a true issue. Carbon emission is a leading cause and has caused an increase in disastrous climate related events. We collected data from the Global Carbon Project website to obtain global greenhouse gas emissions data per country and emission sector.

The code is used to analyze these carbon emission patterns to see which countries contribute large amounts of carbon emissions. 

The code analyzes the csv file to create various visual representations such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and regression lines for the top five emitting countries.

Additionally, each sector is broken up and analyzed to identify trends of the carbon emitting sectors. Visual representations include a bar chart, line graph, and pie chart.
